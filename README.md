# Description
It is known that certain diseases have genetic predispositions. However, we also know that genetic predispositions are often not only related to one disease, but perhaps also with other diseases. This tool allows the user to investigate whether a certain disease has any genetic predispositions in common with other diseases, such as autoimmune diseases. 

The data is fetched from the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint. The SPARQL query used in the project is located in the script section of the [source code](https://github.com/Abi2222/Programming-in-the-Life-Sciences-PRA3006-/blob/main/Source%20Code/Source%20Code.html).

# Question
Are any of the genetic predispositions for certain disease also present in other diseases?

# Usage
* Download the source code [source code](https://github.com/Abi2222/Programming-in-the-Life-Sciences-PRA3006-/blob/main/Source%20Code/Source%20Code.html) by clicking the download button above the code
* Open the file in a web browser. You will see Inflammatory Bowel Diseases' genetic common genetic predispositions which is the default
* Explore the interactive pie chart to understand the shared genetic predispositions
* Hover over the segments to view more detailed information about genes and associated diseases
* Use the search functionality to find the case for other diseases. Note that you need to find the Wikidata entry for the disease and write the code (Q...) into the search box. Example below

# Description
It is known that IBD is not just a sporadic disease, but also has (to some extent) genetic predispositions. However, we also know that genetic predispositions are often not only related to one disease, but perhaps also with other diseases. In this project we will investigate whether IBD has any genetic predispositions in common with other diseases, such as autoimmune diseases. 

The data is fetched from the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint. The SPARQL query used in the project is located in the script section of the [source code](https://github.com/Abi2222/Programming-in-the-Life-Sciences-PRA3006-/blob/main/Source%20Code/Source%20Code.html).

# Research Question
Are any of the genetic predispositions for IBD also present in other diseases?
